# single-landing-page

I have created a promotion page for a bicycle product using HTML5, Bootstrap 5 CSS, and JavaScript, and should include sections such as a welcome section, about us section, product showcase section, testimonials section, call-to-action section, and contact us section.
The landing page is designed with a mobile-first approach and uses responsive design techniques such as fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. It is also optimized for search engines and has clear and concise content that is easy to read and understand.

I have temporarily hosted this website at: https://single-landing-page.stackstaging.com

You can find the code in my GitHub Repository: https://github.com/R-U-Fun/single-landing-page

I have completed this project over a period of 2-3 days.

# Navigation Bar: The navigation bar is created using Bootstrap's navbar component. It includes links to various sections of the website, ensuring easy navigation. The navbar is responsive, with a toggle button for smaller screens.

# Welcome Section: This section serves as an introduction to Waterlily Bicycles, highlighting the brand's focus on innovation and adventure. It features a brief description, a slogan, and links to different sections of the website.

# About Us Section: The About Us section provides a detailed overview of the company, including its founding principles, commitment to sustainability, and key features and benefits of their bicycles. The information is organized using an accordion component for better readability and user experience.

# Products Section: The Products section showcases various bicycle models available for purchase. Each product is displayed in a card format with an image, description, and price. Clicking on a product opens a modal with more detailed information.

# Move It Section: This section features an interactive 3D model of a bicycle, using Three.js for rendering and localStorage for caching the model data. The script initializes a 3D scene, loads the model, and provides controls for interaction.

# Build Section: The Build section is designed to showcase the customization options available for customers. It includes images and descriptions of different build options, emphasizing the brand's focus on personalized bicycles.

# Contact Us Section: This section provides contact information such as phone number, email address, and physical address. If also includes a contact form for visitors to submit inquiries or feedback.
